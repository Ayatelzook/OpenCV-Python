# Object Detection with Haar Cascade and OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using Haar Cascade classifiers with OpenCV. The application captures video from a webcam, applies Haar Cascade detection, and allows dynamic adjustments of detection parameters through trackbars.

## Features

- Real-time video capture from a webcam.
- Object detection using Haar Cascade classifier.
- Adjustable detection parameters including scale, neighbors, minimum area, and brightness.
- Display of detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

## Haarcascade 

-creating cascade file using cascade-Trainer-Gui 
-collecting positive and negative data -->Arduino.xml from Google by using intNest extension
-more collection of data is more better
