# Real-time HSV Color Filtering with OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time color filtering using the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space with OpenCV. The program allows users to adjust HSV thresholds via trackbars to filter specific colors from a video feed captured by a webcam.

## Features

- Real-time video capture from a webcam.
- Adjustable HSV thresholds using trackbars.
- Live color filtering based on HSV values.
- Displays the original video, mask, and filtered result side by side.

## Result
