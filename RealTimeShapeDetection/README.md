# Contour Detection with OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time contour detection using OpenCV. It captures video from a webcam, applies various image processing techniques, and displays contours with additional information such as the number of points and area of detected contours.

## Features

- Real-time video capture from a webcam.
- Adjustable Canny edge detection thresholds via trackbars.
- Contour detection and visualization.
- Display of contour information including the number of points and area.
- Multi-image display of processed results (original, grayscale, Canny edges, dilated edges, and contours).
